# Purpose

This repo is a playground for testing out PHP7 in the command line. The goal will be to have an interactive command line that takes a single word and compliments every word that start with E, drags wording starting with C, and is neutral to every other word.

## Revised

Will set up an interactive commandline which will compliment and terminate on E words, and continue looping on other lettered words.

This is built using PHP7.2 on ubuntu v16.04.
